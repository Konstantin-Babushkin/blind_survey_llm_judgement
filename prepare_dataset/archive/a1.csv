A7,"Brantley's confidence issues have really impacted his performance in a negative way. He's a new member of the team, so I'll cut him some slack. But he's constantly questioning whether he's approaching his assignments in the right way. Moreover his self-doubt impacts the impression that he gives to clients, so I'm always nervous to have him with me in meetings. I think, Brantley has a ton of room to grow."
A8,Camille Hahn performance shows a lot of inconsistency. She didn't perform well on the given tasks and goals. There were times that she had a stellar performance. We believe that she has potential to do better in the future.
A9,"Mr. Reid has been with the company for the last two years. His work is consistent and he puts his full effort into his work. He follows instructions well, but his abilities seem limited to his current experience level. Other workers hired at the same time have shown more growth within the field."
A10,Alex's work is greatly appreciated. He achieves at the level that is expected of him and complies with what is expected. He is a valuable asset to our team. I would like to see Alex to strive to go above and behind in his work. I believe that he has great potential to become a more critical component within the company. Alex can strive to improve his communication skills in specifically.
A11,"Alina's work for this project was not as good as her previous work, however, it is still very much usable. Alina's work in the past has been remarkable- she pays close attention to detail, triple checks her work, and always makes sure her work is as clear and concise as it can be. I always look forward to working with Alina, because her work is, as I stated before, quite well put together."
A12,"I have been so impessed with Frederick Rogers work at our company. Fred as he prefers to be called, outshines the competition every single day; he goes above and beyond what is expected of him. If Fred keeps doing what he has been I feel as he will be able to climb up in our infrastructure. He has been an outstanding employee and I'm so glad he works for our company!"
