A7,"Brantley’s confidence issues are negatively affecting his performance and client interactions. As a new team member, he shows potential, but his self-doubt hinders progress and raises concerns in meetings. He has significant room to grow.","Brantley's confidence issues have really impacted his performance in a negative way. He's a new member of the team, so I'll cut him some slack. But he's constantly questioning whether he's approaching his assignments in the right way. Moreover his self-doubt impacts the impression that he gives to clients, so I'm always nervous to have him with me in meetings. I think, Brantley has a ton of room to grow."

I always look forward to working with Alina, because her work is, as I stated before, quite well put together."
