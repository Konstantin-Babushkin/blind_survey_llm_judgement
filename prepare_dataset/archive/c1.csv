B7,"Isaac has demonstrated average performance this quarter. He was able to maintain an efficient workflow standard, and he was able to provide up-to-date and accurate analysis of data. Significant improvements, however, would be communication skills. He is encouraged to participate more actively in meetings and project discussions. His data analysis insights would definitely help his colleagues do their jobs better as well."
B8,April Craft is your typical employee. She tends to do her job and show up on time. With that said she doesn't seem particularly interested in the work she is given. Hopefully we see some positive growth in the near future.
B9,"Unfortunately, Mr. Stanley has shown time and time again that he has issues performing. For example, last week he had a deadline that he knew of, instead he took long lunches and never made the deadline. Also, his ability to show up on time and dressed accordingly has never happened. Everyday Wade has been a minimum of 15+ minutes late! This is very unacceptable, he is a nice person and I wish him the best, but potential for growth is not there."
B10,Allan Logan touches anything and it turns to gold. Nothing but the most capable hand in the team. He has shown he can achieve what many would dream of. Overall his capability has been an asset and a beacon of expertise.
B11,"Aniya is very good at what she does, and a favourite of the whole team. At the end of the quarter, she is one of the members we rely on the most due to her high output. She is a consistent worker. Unlikely to be moved into managerial roles as she has struggled with leadership."
B12,"Riley is an excellent worker who gets her work done whenever we need her. She also offers excellent ideas in team meetings, and has a very ""big picture"" vision of the company. Will go far."
B13,"Kallie has struggled to find her footing at our company. She's repeatedly turned in work product containing typos, grammar issues, and content mistakes. The good thing is that I trust that Kallie will make great strides moving forward to improve. Every time I give her feedback or mark up documents for her, she takes my comments very seriously and always does better the next time. I believe she has the will and desire to become a reliable member of our department."
B14,"Elliot Gray is a hard worker but delivers to a standard level. The group tasks he has undertaken with the team have always been to an adequate standard. What he lacks in momentum he makes up for in good work. He has shown that he is capable of holding his on, despite the circumstances."
B15,Joseph Cook is a consistent performer. He always gets the basic job done even though he could do better. He does not take as much time as he should to be at a higher performance level. He has shown only moderate potential which is risky.
B16,"Kallie within the past term hasn't quite adjusted to our team yet. She seems to still be fitting into the workload and finding a place to really catch a stride. Because of this, her performance isn't quite at our team's expectation yet. However, she possess skills and an attitude that can immensely pay off very soon once she learns the ropes."
B17,Mr. Burgess has good communication skills and works well with the team. He shows great leadership potential and the ability to rally a group around a common cause.
B18,"Kayden Hill struggles with the tasks set before him. He is easily frustrated, and tends to want to give up. He is aloof with his team. He seems unhappy with where he is within the team."
