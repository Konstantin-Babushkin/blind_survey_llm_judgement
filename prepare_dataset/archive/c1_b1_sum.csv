A7,Isaac delivered average performance with strong data analysis and workflow efficiency. Key area for improvement is communication—needs to actively participate in meetings and share insights to better support colleagues.,"Isaac has demonstrated average performance this quarter. He was able to maintain an efficient workflow standard, and he was able to provide up-to-date and accurate analysis of data. Significant improvements, however, would be communication skills. He is encouraged to participate more actively in meetings and project discussions. His data analysis insights would definitely help his colleagues do their jobs better as well."

A9,"Mr. Stanley consistently underperforms: missed deadlines, habitual tardiness (15+ mins daily), and inappropriate dress. Despite being personable, he shows no potential for growth. Performance issues are ongoing and unacceptable.","Unfortunately, Mr. Stanley has shown time and time again that he has issues performing. For example, last week he had a deadline that he knew of, instead he took long lunches and never made the deadline. Also, his ability to show up on time and dressed accordingly has never happened. Everyday Wade has been a minimum of 15+ minutes late! This is very unacceptable, he is a nice person and I wish him the best, but potential for growth is not there."
