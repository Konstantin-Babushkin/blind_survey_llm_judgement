ORIGINAL:
My friend and colleague, Matthew Reid, is a great addition to any team. His work is quite impressive, never late, and some of the finest on our division. However, with such a great work ethic that he fails to apply fully to reaching a higher position in this company, I believe he has his eyes on other ventures. I would love to recruit and keep Matthew in our company, but I can't trust that we won't pour resources into his success only for him to leave for a bigger company.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Matthew is highly skilled, reliable, and produces top-tier work, making him a valuable team member. However, his ambition may extend beyond the current role, raising concerns about long-term retention. To support his growth and strengthen his commitment, leadership should engage Matthew in a development conversation, clarify advancement opportunities, involve him in strategic projects, and discuss alignment of his goals with the company’s future. This proactive approach can build mutual trust and encourage him to grow within the organization.
[2] Feedback means Matthew produces exceptional, timely work but appears uncommitted to advancement, suggesting he may leave for other ventures. This implies trust issues may limit growth opportunities despite high performance. Matthew should: 1) Clarify career goals with manager next week, 2) Discuss desired internal advancement paths, 3) Propose one initiative showing long-term commitment.
[3] Matthew's work is excellent, but management perceives a lack of ambition to grow within the company, creating mistrust about his loyalty. This stalls his growth. If he wishes to stay, Matthew should proactively discuss his long-term career goals with his manager to build confidence.
[4] Matthew, this feedback highlights your exceptional work quality and reliability, making you a valuable team member. However, it also suggests a perception that you may not be fully committed to long-term growth within the company, leading to a reluctance to invest further in your development. To address this, Matthew should proactively communicate his career aspirations within the company, seek out opportunities for internal advancement, and demonstrate a clear commitment to his future at the organization.

My friend and colleague, Matthew Reid, is a great addition to any team. His work is quite impressive, never late, and some of the finest on our division. However, with such a great work ethic that he fails to apply fully to reaching a higher position in this company, I believe he has his eyes on other ventures. I would love to recruit and keep Matthew in our company, but I can't trust that we won't pour resources into his success only for him to leave for a bigger company.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Feedback means Matthew produces exceptional, timely work but appears uncommitted to advancement, suggesting he may leave for other ventures. This implies trust issues may limit growth opportunities despite high performance. Matthew should: 1) Clarify career goals with manager next week, 2) Discuss desired internal advancement paths, 3) Propose one initiative showing long-term commitment.
[2] Matthew, this feedback highlights your exceptional work quality and reliability, making you a valuable team member. However, it also suggests a perception that you may not be fully committed to long-term growth within the company, leading to a reluctance to invest further in your development. To address this, Matthew should proactively communicate his career aspirations within the company, seek out opportunities for internal advancement, and demonstrate a clear commitment to his future at the organization.
[3] Matthew's work is excellent, but management perceives a lack of ambition to grow within the company, creating mistrust about his loyalty. This stalls his growth. If he wishes to stay, Matthew should proactively discuss his long-term career goals with his manager to build confidence.
[4] Matthew is highly skilled, reliable, and produces top-tier work, making him a valuable team member. However, his ambition may extend beyond the current role, raising concerns about long-term retention. To support his growth and strengthen his commitment, leadership should engage Matthew in a development conversation, clarify advancement opportunities, involve him in strategic projects, and discuss alignment of his goals with the company’s future. This proactive approach can build mutual trust and encourage him to grow within the organization.

Jay Reid's level of work has been very disappointing given the kind of skills he possess. With the right attitude and possibly with a few work adjustments, his work quality could improve.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Jay Reid is underperforming, with work quality that is disappointing given his skills. This implies the issue is attitude, not ability. To improve his standing, Jay should ask his manager for specific feedback on attitude and create a checklist to ensure his work reflects his full capabilities.
[2] Jay, your manager believes your current work quality doesn't reflect your full potential and skills. This feedback suggests a gap between perceived ability and actual output, potentially impacting your standing and growth opportunities. To address this, Jay should: 1) Schedule a meeting with the manager to understand specific areas of "disappointing" work. 2) Propose concrete "work adjustments" that could improve quality. 3) Reflect on and discuss "attitude" concerns, seeking clarification and demonstrating openness to change.
[3] Feedback means Jay's output underutilizes his skills, but adjustments could unlock improvement. This indicates current disappointment yet belief in recoverable potential. Jay should: 1) Request specific skill-to-task alignment ideas from manager, 2) Identify one attitude adjustment focus area, 3) Implement two productivity tweaks by month-end.
[4] Jay Reid has strong skills, but his current performance is below expectations. This feedback suggests he has potential to improve with a more positive attitude and minor adjustments to his work approach. To move forward, Jay should seek specific feedback on his work, proactively communicate with his manager about challenges, align on clear quality standards, and demonstrate consistent effort and accountability in daily tasks.

ORIGINAL:
Jay Reid's level of work has been very disappointing given the kind of skills he possess. With the right attitude and possibly with a few work adjustments, his work quality could improve.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Jay Reid has strong skills, but his current performance is below expectations. This feedback suggests he has potential to improve with a more positive attitude and minor adjustments to his work approach. To move forward, Jay should seek specific feedback on his work, proactively communicate with his manager about challenges, align on clear quality standards, and demonstrate consistent effort and accountability in daily tasks.
[2] Jay Reid is underperforming, with work quality that is disappointing given his skills. This implies the issue is attitude, not ability. To improve his standing, Jay should ask his manager for specific feedback on attitude and create a checklist to ensure his work reflects his full capabilities.
[3] Jay, your manager believes your current work quality doesn't reflect your full potential and skills. This feedback suggests a gap between perceived ability and actual output, potentially impacting your standing and growth opportunities. To address this, Jay should: 1) Schedule a meeting with the manager to understand specific areas of "disappointing" work. 2) Propose concrete "work adjustments" that could improve quality. 3) Reflect on and discuss "attitude" concerns, seeking clarification and demonstrating openness to change.
[4] Feedback means Jay's output underutilizes his skills, but adjustments could unlock improvement. This indicates current disappointment yet belief in recoverable potential. Jay should: 1) Request specific skill-to-task alignment ideas from manager, 2) Identify one attitude adjustment focus area, 3) Implement two productivity tweaks by month-end.
