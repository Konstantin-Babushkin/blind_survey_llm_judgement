Unfortunately, Mr. Stanley has shown time and time again that he has issues performing. For example, last week he had a deadline that he knew of, instead he took long lunches and never made the deadline. Also, his ability to show up on time and dressed accordingly has never happened. Everyday Wade has been a minimum of 15+ minutes late! This is very unacceptable, he is a nice person and I wish him the best, but potential for growth is not there.

ORIGINAL:
Jay frequently shows up late to the office and misses deadlines that have been set for his assignments. Unfortunately each assignment I've received from him to date has been subpar since they frequently have math errors.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Jay’s consistent tardiness and missed deadlines are impacting team reliability, while the recurring math errors in his work suggest a need for improved accuracy and attention to detail. This pattern indicates gaps in time management and work quality that, if unaddressed, may affect his performance standing. To improve, Jay should (1) establish a structured morning routine to ensure punctuality, (2) use a task tracker to monitor deadlines and break assignments into manageable steps, (3) implement a review process to verify calculations before submission, and (4) proactively seek feedback early in assignments to align with expectations.
[2] Feedback means Jay consistently delivers late, error-prone work with poor punctuality. This signals urgent need for reliability improvements. Jay should: 1) Use calendar alerts for deadlines/arrival times, 2) Implement peer-review for all assignments, 3) Enroll in company math tools training this month.
[3] Jay is not meeting basic job expectations regarding punctuality, deadlines, and work quality, with frequent errors noted. This seriously jeopardizes his position. He must immediately improve his timekeeping and implement a system to proofread all work for errors before submission.
[4] Jay, this feedback indicates a need to improve punctuality, reliability, and accuracy. It suggests that Jay's current performance is impacting his standing and growth opportunities.
