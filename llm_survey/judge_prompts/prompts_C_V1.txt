Kallie has struggled to find her footing at our company. She's repeatedly turned in work product containing typos, grammar issues, and content mistakes. The good thing is that I trust that Kallie will make great strides moving forward to improve. Every time I give her feedback or mark up documents for her, she takes my comments very seriously and always does better the next time. I believe she has the will and desire to become a reliable member of our department.

ORIGINAL:
Kohen Norris has been for a lack of better words incompetent. I would like to say more positive things about him but he has not shown any potential in regards to his work. He often is late and smells poorly despite our company guidelines. I feel it is in our best interest to drop him from the company.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Kohen Norris’s performance has consistently fallen below expectations, with concerns around reliability, adherence to company standards, and overall work quality. This feedback suggests serious doubts about his fit in the role and indicates that immediate, significant improvement is needed to continue employment. To respond, Kohen should (1) arrive on time every day starting immediately, (2) follow workplace hygiene guidelines without exception, (3) request a performance improvement plan to clarify expectations, and (4) seek weekly feedback to demonstrate commitment to change.
[2] Feedback indicates Kohen’s work shows incompetence with chronic lateness and hygiene violations, risking termination. This implies immediate jeopardy to his role. Kohen must: 1) Address hygiene per guidelines *today*, 2) Set alarms to ensure punctuality starting tomorrow, 3) Request a performance improvement plan detailing expectations within 48 hours.

Thaddeus is a talented resource though he is not focused many of the times. He is able to contribute up to 80% of his abilities & skill set. Would like him to work on his weaknesses & multiply strength areas in order to become a better contributor. He is a vital member of the team for this project. However, would like him to become a main asset in fulfilling team objectives on regular occasions to climb up the ladder in hierarchy.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Thaddeus is a talented, vital team member whose lack of focus prevents him from reaching his full potential. This limits his advancement. He should ask his manager to define key focus areas and use time management techniques to improve his consistency and impact on team goals.
[2] Thaddeus, this feedback indicates you are a valued, talented team member, but your focus sometimes wavers, preventing you from utilizing your full potential (80% of abilities). To grow, you need to address weaknesses and leverage strengths to become a more consistent, primary contributor to team objectives, which is key for career advancement. Thaddeus should now identify specific areas where focus is lacking, seek opportunities to apply his strengths more consistently, and proactively communicate his commitment to maximizing his contributions.
[3] Feedback means Thaddeus leverages only 80% of his talent due to focus gaps, limiting advancement despite being vital. This suggests unlocking full potential could accelerate his growth. Thaddeus should: 1) Block 2 daily "deep work" hours distraction-free, 2) Map strengths/weaknesses with his manager next week, 3) Lead one small team objective monthly to demonstrate consistency. (289 chars)
[4] Thaddeus is recognized for his talent and currently contributes about 80% of his potential, but inconsistent focus limits his impact. This feedback means he has strong capabilities, yet underutilizes them, which affects team outcomes. To grow into a more vital, consistent asset and advance professionally, Thaddeus should actively work on strengthening focus, addressing weaknesses, and deepening his key skills. Recommended actions: (1) Set daily priorities with clear goals to improve focus, (2) Seek regular feedback to identify blind spots, (3) Take ownership of one key project task weekly to build accountability, and (4) Dedicate time to skill development in areas critical to team success.

ORIGINAL:
Thaddeus is a talented resource though he is not focused many of the times. He is able to contribute up to 80% of his abilities & skill set. Would like him to work on his weaknesses & multiply strength areas in order to become a better contributor. He is a vital member of the team for this project. However, would like him to become a main asset in fulfilling team objectives on regular occasions to climb up the ladder in hierarchy.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Thaddeus is a talented, vital team member whose lack of focus prevents him from reaching his full potential. This limits his advancement. He should ask his manager to define key focus areas and use time management techniques to improve his consistency and impact on team goals.
[2] Thaddeus, this feedback indicates you are a valued, talented team member, but your focus sometimes wavers, preventing you from utilizing your full potential (80% of abilities). To grow, you need to address weaknesses and leverage strengths to become a more consistent, primary contributor to team objectives, which is key for career advancement. Thaddeus should now identify specific areas where focus is lacking, seek opportunities to apply his strengths more consistently, and proactively communicate his commitment to maximizing his contributions.
[3] Thaddeus is recognized for his talent and currently contributes about 80% of his potential, but inconsistent focus limits his impact. This feedback means he has strong capabilities, yet underutilizes them, which affects team outcomes. To grow into a more vital, consistent asset and advance professionally, Thaddeus should actively work on strengthening focus, addressing weaknesses, and deepening his key skills. Recommended actions: (1) Set daily priorities with clear goals to improve focus, (2) Seek regular feedback to identify blind spots, (3) Take ownership of one key project task weekly to build accountability, and (4) Dedicate time to skill development in areas critical to team success.
[4] Feedback means Thaddeus leverages only 80% of his talent due to focus gaps, limiting advancement despite being vital. This suggests unlocking full potential could accelerate his growth. Thaddeus should: 1) Block 2 daily "deep work" hours distraction-free, 2) Map strengths/weaknesses with his manager next week, 3) Lead one small team objective monthly to demonstrate consistency.
