George does not complete work on time and needs to be constantly supervised. He does show high potential due to the work he does eventually submit. George is very intelligent but some incentive should be made to get him to realize his potential. George could probably choose a different career path within the company to ignite his ambition. George might seem lazy sometimes but shows high potential of being a great contributor.

CANDIDATES:
[1] George’s feedback indicates that while his work quality shows strong potential, his inconsistent timeliness and need for close supervision are hindering his performance. This suggests he may lack motivation or alignment with his current role, not ability. To grow, George should explore internal career paths that better match his interests and strengths, which could reignite his drive. He should proactively request a meeting with his manager to discuss role adjustments, set clear deadlines with accountability check-ins, seek mentorship, and identify specific goals to track progress—turning potential into consistent results.
[2] Feedback means George misses deadlines requiring supervision, though submitted work shows high intelligence/potential. This indicates role misalignment may hinder contributions. George should: 1) Propose one alternative role interest by month-end, 2) Implement time-blocking for daily tasks, 3) Schedule bi-weekly progress reviews with manager.
[3] George shows high potential with intelligent work, but his untimeliness and need for supervision are major concerns. This hurts his standing. He should adopt a task management system and talk to his manager about roles that might better ignite his ambition and strengths.
[4] George, this feedback indicates a perception that he struggles with timely completion and requires frequent oversight, despite the high quality of his eventual output. This suggests that while his intelligence and potential are recognized, his current work habits are hindering his standing and growth. To address this, George should proactively communicate his progress on tasks, set realistic deadlines for himself and adhere to them, and explore internal career paths that might better align with his ambitions and ignite his motivation.

ORIGINAL:
Bailey Hunter's daily production oscillates from poor to excellent from day-to day. One day Bailey will competently produce a 50-page brief and the next day will struggle to complete five transmittal letters. Her interpersonal skills are unexceptional, neither good nor bad. On balance, I don't believe she is long for this job.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Bailey's performance is seen as highly inconsistent, making her unreliable despite moments of excellence. This puts her long-term position at risk. Bailey should track her daily work to find patterns and discuss with her manager how to build a more consistent, dependable output.
[2] Bailey, your manager notes significant inconsistency in your daily output, ranging from excellent to poor, and views your interpersonal skills as average. This suggests your overall performance is not meeting expectations, potentially jeopardizing your standing. To address this, Bailey should: 1) Track daily output to identify patterns and causes of inconsistency. 2) Seek feedback on specific areas for improvement in both production and interpersonal skills. 3) Propose a plan to manager for consistent performance and skill development.
[3] Feedback means Bailey’s output fluctuates severely between excellent and poor, with neutral interpersonal skills. This implies inconsistency risks job stability. Bailey should: 1) Track daily productivity triggers in a journal, 2) Break large tasks into hourly milestones, 3) Request clarity on performance expectations immediately.
[4] Bailey’s performance is inconsistent, with significant daily fluctuations in productivity, making it difficult to rely on her for steady output. While her interpersonal skills are neutral, the unpredictability in her work quality raises concerns about her long-term fit in the role. To improve, Bailey should (1) track daily tasks to identify patterns in her productivity, (2) seek structured feedback after each assignment, (3) work with a mentor to develop time management strategies, and (4) proactively communicate challenges early to prevent missed expectations.

TASK TYPE: Interpret

CRITERION: Constructiveness

INSTRUCTION:
Rank from most to least helpful and constructive.

ORIGINAL:
Bailey Hunter's daily production oscillates from poor to excellent from day-to day. One day Bailey will competently produce a 50-page brief and the next day will struggle to complete five transmittal letters. Her interpersonal skills are unexceptional, neither good nor bad. On balance, I don't believe she is long for this job.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Bailey's performance is seen as highly inconsistent, making her unreliable despite moments of excellence. This puts her long-term position at risk. Bailey should track her daily work to find patterns and discuss with her manager how to build a more consistent, dependable output.
[2] Feedback means Bailey’s output fluctuates severely between excellent and poor, with neutral interpersonal skills. This implies inconsistency risks job stability. Bailey should: 1) Track daily productivity triggers in a journal, 2) Break large tasks into hourly milestones, 3) Request clarity on performance expectations immediately.
