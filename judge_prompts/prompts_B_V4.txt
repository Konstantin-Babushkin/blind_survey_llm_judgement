Unfortunately, Mr. Stanley has shown time and time again that he has issues performing. For example, last week he had a deadline that he knew of, instead he took long lunches and never made the deadline. Also, his ability to show up on time and dressed accordingly has never happened. Everyday Wade has been a minimum of 15+ minutes late! This is very unacceptable, he is a nice person and I wish him the best, but potential for growth is not there.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Mr. Stanley consistently underperforms, misses deadlines, and has issues with punctuality. He shows no potential for growth within the company.
[2] Mr. Stanley consistently underperforms: missed deadlines, habitual tardiness (15+ mins daily), and inappropriate dress. Despite being personable, he shows no potential for growth. Performance issues are ongoing and unacceptable.
[3] Wade: Repeated performance issues (missed deadline, chronic lateness >15mins, dress). Nice person, but no growth potential.
[4] Stanley consistently underperforms, misses deadlines (e.g., last week's), and is habitually late (+15 min daily) and unprofessionally dressed. Lacks growth potential.

ORIGINAL:
Kallie right now is in an interesting position. She is performing really poorly, not meeting deadlines, and generally produces low quality work. However, she has given an incredible amount of effort into improving herself and learning from her mistakes. She always responds well to feed back and proactively seeks to improve herself. Although she is isn;t doing well now, she will definitely improve with experience.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Kallie is currently struggling with performance, missing deadlines and delivering work below expectations. However, her dedication to growth is evident—she actively seeks feedback, learns from mistakes, and shows strong initiative to improve. This suggests her current performance doesn’t reflect her potential. With continued support and experience, she is likely to grow into a more capable and reliable contributor. To move forward, Kallie should prioritize time management by breaking tasks into smaller steps, set personal deadlines ahead of actual due dates, request regular check-ins with her manager for guidance, and document feedback to track progress and avoid repeating errors.
[2] Feedback means Kallie’s current work quality/timeliness are poor despite exceptional improvement efforts. This suggests immediate focus areas but strong long-term potential if development continues. Kallie should: 1) Request weekly priority alignment with manager, 2) Submit drafts 2 days early for feedback, 3) Shadow a top performer weekly.

Kallie right now is in an interesting position. She is performing really poorly, not meeting deadlines, and generally produces low quality work. However, she has given an incredible amount of effort into improving herself and learning from her mistakes. She always responds well to feed back and proactively seeks to improve herself. Although she is isn;t doing well now, she will definitely improve with experience.

George does not complete work on time and needs to be constantly supervised. He does show high potential due to the work he does eventually submit. George is very intelligent but some incentive should be made to get him to realize his potential. George could probably choose a different career path within the company to ignite his ambition. George might seem lazy sometimes but shows high potential of being a great contributor.

CANDIDATES:
[1] George shows high potential with intelligent work, but his untimeliness and need for supervision are major concerns. This hurts his standing. He should adopt a task management system and talk to his manager about roles that might better ignite his ambition and strengths.
[2] George, this feedback indicates a perception that he struggles with timely completion and requires frequent oversight, despite the high quality of his eventual output. This suggests that while his intelligence and potential are recognized, his current work habits are hindering his standing and growth. To address this, George should proactively communicate his progress on tasks, set realistic deadlines for himself and adhere to them, and explore internal career paths that might better align with his ambitions and ignite his motivation.
[3] Feedback means George misses deadlines requiring supervision, though submitted work shows high intelligence/potential. This indicates role misalignment may hinder contributions. George should: 1) Propose one alternative role interest by month-end, 2) Implement time-blocking for daily tasks, 3) Schedule bi-weekly progress reviews with manager.
[4] George’s feedback indicates that while his work quality shows strong potential, his inconsistent timeliness and need for close supervision are hindering his performance. This suggests he may lack motivation or alignment with his current role, not ability. To grow, George should explore internal career paths that better match his interests and strengths, which could reignite his drive. He should proactively request a meeting with his manager to discuss role adjustments, set clear deadlines with accountability check-ins, seek mentorship, and identify specific goals to track progress—turning potential into consistent results.

George is very intelligent but some incentive should be made to get him to realize his potential. George could probably choose a different career path within the company to ignite his ambition. George might seem lazy sometimes but shows high potential of being a great contributor.

CANDIDATES:
[1] George shows high potential with intelligent work, but his untimeliness and need for supervision are major concerns. This hurts his standing. He should adopt a task management system and talk to his manager about roles that might better ignite his ambition and strengths.
[2] George, this feedback indicates a perception that he struggles with timely completion and requires frequent oversight, despite the high quality of his eventual output. This suggests that while his intelligence and potential are recognized, his current work habits are hindering his standing and growth. To address this, George should proactively communicate his progress on tasks, set realistic deadlines for himself and adhere to them, and explore internal career paths that might better align with his ambitions and ignite his motivation.
[3] George’s feedback indicates that while his work quality shows strong potential, his inconsistent timeliness and need for close supervision are hindering his performance. This suggests he may lack motivation or alignment with his current role, not ability. To grow, George should explore internal career paths that better match his interests and strengths, which could reignite his drive. He should proactively request a meeting with his manager to discuss role adjustments, set clear deadlines with accountability check-ins, seek mentorship, and identify specific goals to track progress—turning potential into consistent results.
[4] Feedback means George misses deadlines requiring supervision, though submitted work shows high intelligence/potential. This indicates role misalignment may hinder contributions. George should: 1) Propose one alternative role interest by month-end, 2) Implement time-blocking for daily tasks, 3) Schedule bi-weekly progress reviews with manager.
