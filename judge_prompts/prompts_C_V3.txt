Kallie has struggled to find her footing at our company. She's repeatedly turned in work product containing typos, grammar issues, and content mistakes.

ORIGINAL:
My friend and colleague, Matthew Reid, is a great addition to any team. His work is quite impressive, never late, and some of the finest on our division. However, with such a great work ethic that he fails to apply fully to reaching a higher position in this company, I believe he has his eyes on other ventures. I would love to recruit and keep Matthew in our company, but I can't trust that we won't pour resources into his success only for him to leave for a bigger company.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Matthew is highly skilled, reliable, and produces top-tier work, making him a valuable team member. However, his ambition may extend beyond the current role, raising concerns about long-term retention. To support his growth and strengthen his commitment, leadership should engage Matthew in a development conversation, clarify advancement opportunities, involve him in strategic projects, and discuss alignment of his goals with the company’s future. This proactive approach can build mutual trust and encourage him to grow within the organization.
[2] Feedback means Matthew produces exceptional, timely work but appears uncommitted to advancement, suggesting he may leave for other ventures. This implies trust issues may limit growth opportunities despite high performance. Matthew should: 1) Clarify career goals with manager next week, 2) Discuss desired internal advancement paths, 3) Propose one initiative showing long-term commitment.
[3] Matthew's work is excellent, but management perceives a lack of ambition to grow within the company, creating mistrust about his loyalty. This stalls his growth. If he wishes to stay, Matthew should proactively discuss his long-term career goals with his manager to build confidence.
[4] Matthew, this feedback highlights your exceptional work quality and reliability, making you a valuable team member. However, it also suggests a perception that you may not be fully committed to long-term growth within the company, leading to a reluctance to invest further in your development. To address this, Matthew should proactively communicate his career aspirations within the company, seek out opportunities for internal advancement, and demonstrate a clear commitment to his future at the organization.

ORIGINAL:
My friend and colleague, Matthew Reid, is a great addition to any team. His work is quite impressive, never late, and some of the finest on our division. However, with such a great work ethic that he fails to apply fully to reaching a higher position in this company, I believe he has his eyes on other ventures. I would love to recruit and keep Matthew in our company, but I can't trust that we won't pour resources into his success only for him to leave for a bigger company.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Feedback means Matthew produces exceptional, timely work but appears uncommitted to advancement, suggesting he may leave for other ventures. This implies trust issues may limit growth opportunities despite high performance. Matthew should: 1) Clarify career goals with manager next week, 2) Discuss desired internal advancement paths, 3) Propose one initiative showing long-term commitment.
[2] Matthew is highly skilled, reliable, and produces top-tier work, making him a valuable team member. However, his ambition may extend beyond the current role, raising concerns about long-term retention. To support his growth and strengthen his commitment, leadership should engage Matthew in a development conversation, clarify advancement opportunities, involve him in strategic projects, and discuss alignment of his goals with the company’s future. This proactive approach can build mutual trust and encourage him to grow within the organization.
[3] Matthew's work is excellent, but management perceives a lack of ambition to grow within the company, creating mistrust about his loyalty. This stalls his growth. If he wishes to stay, Matthew should proactively discuss his long-term career goals with his manager to build confidence.
[4] Matthew, this feedback highlights your exceptional work quality and reliability, making you a valuable team member. However, it also suggests a perception that you may not be fully committed to long-term growth within the company, leading to a reluctance to invest further in your development. To address this, Matthew should proactively communicate his career aspirations within the company, seek out opportunities for internal advancement, and demonstrate a clear commitment to his future at the organization.

George didn't deliver as well as hoped. However, he displays a great deal of all skills necessary for growth. With time, George will prove to be an asset to the company. Given the opportunity, George has the ability to advance beyond his given skill set.

CANDIDATES:
[1] George’s recent performance fell short of expectations, but management sees strong underlying skills and high potential for future growth. He should meet with his manager to review what went wrong, and then ask for a new, challenging task to demonstrate his true capabilities.
[2] George, your performance didn't meet expectations, but your manager recognizes your strong foundational skills and potential for significant growth. This feedback implies that while your current output needs improvement, you are seen as a valuable long-term asset with high advancement potential. To respond, George should: (1) Proactively seek clarification on specific areas for improvement, (2) Request opportunities to apply and develop his skills, (3) Set clear, measurable goals for his immediate contributions, and (4) Regularly check in with his manager on progress.
[3] Feedback means George underdelivered recently but possesses all skills for growth, positioning him as a future asset with advancement potential. This signals patience for development but requires proof of progress. George should: 1) Diagnose delivery gaps with manager immediately, 2) Create biweekly milestone plans for complex tasks, 3) Seek one skill-stretching project quarterly.
[4] George’s current performance hasn’t met expectations, but he demonstrates strong potential through his foundational skills and readiness to grow. This feedback suggests he is viewed as a developmental candidate with long-term value. To progress, George should seek regular feedback, pursue skill-building opportunities, take initiative on projects, and work to consistently deliver results to build trust and prove reliability.

CRITERION: Motivational tone

INSTRUCTION:
Rank from most to least empathetic and encouraging.

ORIGINAL:
George didn't deliver as well as hoped. However, he displays a great deal of all skills necessary for growth. With time, George will prove to be an asset to the company. Given the opportunity, George has the ability to advance beyond his given skill set.

CANDIDATES:
[1] George, your performance didn't meet expectations, but your manager recognizes your strong foundational skills and potential for significant growth. This feedback implies that while your current output needs improvement, you are seen as a valuable long-term asset with high advancement potential. To respond, George should: (1) Proactively seek clarification on specific areas for improvement, (2) Request opportunities to apply and develop his skills, (3) Set clear, measurable goals for his immediate contributions, and (4) Regularly check in with his manager on progress.
[2] Feedback means George underdelivered recently but possesses all skills for growth, positioning him as a future asset with advancement potential. This signals patience for development but requires proof of progress. George should: 1) Diagnose delivery gaps with manager immediately, 2) Create biweekly milestone plans for complex tasks, 3) Seek one skill-stretching project quarterly.
[3] George’s current performance hasn’t met expectations, but he demonstrates strong potential through his foundational skills and readiness to grow. This feedback suggests he is viewed as a developmental candidate with long-term value. To progress, George should seek regular feedback, pursue skill-building opportunities, take initiative on projects, and work to consistently deliver results to build trust and prove reliability.
[4] George’s recent performance fell short of expectations, but management sees strong underlying skills and high potential for future growth. He should meet with his manager to review what went wrong, and then ask for a new, challenging task to demonstrate his true capabilities.
