John Doe’s performance is regressing, risking clients; reassignment or exit should be considered.

CANDIDATES:
[1] John, recent performance trends show significant regression, raising concerns about client impact. This level is unsustainable. We need to discuss this urgently and carefully evaluate appropriate next steps, which may include performance improvement plans, reassignment possibilities, or potential exit, to ensure team and client stability.
[2] John Doe's recent performance shows a concerning decline, particularly impacting client relationships and project delivery. This regression poses a significant risk to our client satisfaction and business reputation. We need to address this urgently, exploring options such as reassignment to a role that better aligns with his current capabilities or, if improvement isn't seen, considering separation.
[3] John, we have serious concerns about your regressing performance, which is now creating risk with our clients. We must discuss an immediate improvement plan, which may include reassignment or a potential exit.
[4] John Doe's recent performance shows a concerning decline, with repeated errors impacting client outcomes and team reliability. Despite previous feedback, there has been minimal improvement. Given the risk to client relationships and project success, leadership should evaluate options for reassignment or separation.

Kallie right now is in an interesting position. She is performing really poorly, not meeting deadlines, and generally produces low quality work. However, she has given an incredible amount of effort into improving herself and learning from her mistakes. She always responds well to feed back and proactively seeks to improve herself. Although she is isn;t doing well now, she will definitely improve with experience.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Kallie is currently struggling with performance, missing deadlines and delivering work below expectations. However, her dedication to growth is evident—she actively seeks feedback, learns from mistakes, and shows strong initiative to improve. This suggests her current performance doesn’t reflect her potential. With continued support and experience, she is likely to grow into a more capable and reliable contributor. To move forward, Kallie should prioritize time management by breaking tasks into smaller steps, set personal deadlines ahead of actual due dates, request regular check-ins with her manager for guidance, and document feedback to track progress and avoid repeating errors.
[2] Feedback means Kallie’s current work quality/timeliness are poor despite exceptional improvement efforts. This suggests immediate focus areas but strong long-term potential if development continues. Kallie should: 1) Request weekly priority alignment with manager, 2) Submit drafts 2 days early for feedback, 3) Shadow a top performer weekly.
[3] Kallie's current work quality and timeliness are below standard. However, her high effort and positive response to feedback are highly valued, implying strong future potential. Kallie should find a mentor for pre-submission reviews and break tasks into smaller, trackable steps.
[4] Kallie, your current performance is noted as significantly below expectations, with concerns about missed deadlines and low-quality output. However, your exceptional dedication to self-improvement, positive response to feedback, and proactive learning are highly valued. This indicates a strong potential for future growth, and the team believes Kallie will improve significantly with more experience. To address this, Kallie should prioritize meeting all deadlines, meticulously review work for quality before submission, and continue to proactively seek and apply feedback to improve her skills and output.

ORIGINAL:
Kallie right now is in an interesting position. She is performing really poorly, not meeting deadlines, and generally produces low quality work. However, she has given an incredible amount of effort into improving herself and learning from her mistakes. She always responds well to feed back and proactively seeks to improve herself. Although she is isn;t doing well now, she will definitely improve with experience.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Feedback means Kallie’s current work quality/timeliness are poor despite exceptional improvement efforts. This suggests immediate focus areas but strong long-term potential if development continues. Kallie should: 1) Request weekly priority alignment with manager, 2) Submit drafts 2 days early for feedback, 3) Shadow a top performer weekly.
[2] Kallie is currently struggling with performance, missing deadlines and delivering work below expectations. However, her dedication to growth is evident—she actively seeks feedback, learns from mistakes, and shows strong initiative to improve. This suggests her current performance doesn’t reflect her potential. With continued support and experience, she is likely to grow into a more capable and reliable contributor. To move forward, Kallie should prioritize time management by breaking tasks into smaller steps, set personal deadlines ahead of actual due dates, request regular check-ins with her manager for guidance, and document feedback to track progress and avoid repeating errors.
[3] Kallie's current work quality and timeliness are below standard. However, her high effort and positive response to feedback are highly valued, implying strong future potential. Kallie should find a mentor for pre-submission reviews and break tasks into smaller, trackable steps.
[4] Kallie, your current performance is noted as significantly below expectations, with concerns about missed deadlines and low-quality output. However, your exceptional dedication to self-improvement, positive response to feedback, and proactive learning are highly valued. This indicates a strong potential for future growth, and the team believes Kallie will improve significantly with more experience. To address this, Kallie should prioritize meeting all deadlines, meticulously review work for quality before submission, and continue to proactively seek and apply feedback to improve her skills and output.
