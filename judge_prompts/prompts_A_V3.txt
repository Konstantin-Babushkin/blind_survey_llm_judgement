George Gill ignored prior warnings; quality keeps slipping and team morale suffers—termination advised.

CANDIDATES:
[1] George Gill has consistently disregarded prior performance warnings, resulting in ongoing declines in work quality and a negative impact on team morale. Despite opportunities for improvement, there has been no sustained progress. After careful consideration, termination is recommended.

Not only is she extremely competent, she has the potential to produce even higher quality work as she progresses

CANDIDATES:
[1] Chelsea consistently delivers exceptional work that surpasses expectations, demonstrating both skill and dedication. Her proactive pursuit of growth suggests strong potential for even greater contributions. To continue progressing, Chelsea should seek regular feedback to refine her approach, mentor others to strengthen leadership skills, pursue advanced training in her field, and document her best practices to share with the team.
[2] The feedback means Chelsea’s work quality and self-driven growth are exceptional, with clear potential for greater impact. This positions her as a top talent with leadership readiness. Chelsea should: 1) Mentor one peer quarterly to share expertise, 2) Draft a 12-month growth plan aligning with company goals, 3) Lead one cross-departmental project by year-end to broaden influence.
[3] Chelsea is seen as an exceptional, high-potential employee who consistently surpasses expectations and is eager to learn. Her standing is excellent. To build on this, Chelsea can mentor a teammate to develop leadership skills and discuss her long-term career path with her manager to align her goals.
[4] Chelsea, this feedback highlights her exceptional work quality, consistent exceeding of expectations, and proactive approach to learning and self-improvement. It implies she is a top performer with significant growth potential, likely on a strong trajectory for advancement.

Noah is a really key member to have on our team and I am grateful for all the ways in which he steps up to deliver high quality work for our clients. For example, he's always the first to volunteer for assignments. He's always the last one to leave the office, since he's so committed to reviewing reports and double checking his work in a painstaking way. I can certainly see Noah's dedication as an asset in a manager role in the future. However, I don't see him reaching the director level since he is somewhat abrasive in his communication skills.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Noah is a dedicated, key team member with management potential, but his abrasive communication style is a significant barrier to director-level roles. To improve, Noah can request specific feedback on his communication style and practice active listening in discussions to be more receptive.
[2] Noah's manager values his dedication, high-quality work, and willingness to take on assignments, seeing him as a strong candidate for a manager role. However, his "abrasive" communication style is noted as a barrier to reaching a director level. To address this, Noah should seek feedback on specific instances of abrasive communication, practice active listening and empathetic responses, and consider communication workshops or coaching to refine his interpersonal skills.
[3] The feedback means Noah’s diligence and client focus make him management material, but abrasive communication may limit director prospects. This signals strength in execution over strategic influence. Noah should: 1) Take an active listening workshop by Q3, 2) Request quarterly feedback on communication tone, 3) Practice rephrating critical feedback neutrally before sharing.
[4] Noah’s dedication, initiative, and meticulous work quality make him a valuable team member and a strong candidate for a future managerial role. His commitment to excellence is evident in how he consistently volunteers for assignments and ensures accuracy through thorough review. However, advancement to the director level may be limited by his abrasive communication style, which could hinder collaboration and leadership effectiveness. To grow into higher-level leadership, Noah should focus on refining his interpersonal skills. Recommended actions include: 1) seeking feedback on communication from peers and supervisors, 2) attending a workshop on emotional intelligence or constructive communication, 3) practicing active listening in team settings, and 4) working with a mentor to develop a more inclusive and empathetic leadership style.

CRITERION: Constructiveness

INSTRUCTION:
Rank from most to least helpful and constructive.

ORIGINAL:
Noah is a really key member to have on our team and I am grateful for all the ways in which he steps up to deliver high quality work for our clients. For example, he's always the first to volunteer for assignments. He's always the last one to leave the office, since he's so committed to reviewing reports and double checking his work in a painstaking way. I can certainly see Noah's dedication as an asset in a manager role in the future. However, I don't see him reaching the director level since he is somewhat abrasive in his communication skills.

CANDIDATES:
[1] Noah is a dedicated, key team member with management potential, but his abrasive communication style is a significant barrier to director-level roles. To improve, Noah can request specific feedback on his communication style and practice active listening in discussions to be more receptive.
[2] The feedback means Noah’s diligence and client focus make him management material, but abrasive communication may limit director prospects. This signals strength in execution over strategic influence. Noah should: 1) Take an active listening workshop by Q3, 2) Request quarterly feedback on communication tone, 3) Practice rephrating critical feedback neutrally before sharing.
[3] Noah’s dedication, initiative, and meticulous work quality make him a valuable team member and a strong candidate for a future managerial role. His commitment to excellence is evident in how he consistently volunteers for assignments and ensures accuracy through thorough review. However, advancement to the director level may be limited by his abrasive communication style, which could hinder collaboration and leadership effectiveness. To grow into higher-level leadership, Noah should focus on refining his interpersonal skills. Recommended actions include: 1) seeking feedback on communication from peers and supervisors, 2) attending a workshop on emotional intelligence or constructive communication, 3) practicing active listening in team settings, and 4) working with a mentor to develop a more inclusive and empathetic leadership style.
[4] Noah's manager values his dedication, high-quality work, and willingness to take on assignments, seeing him as a strong candidate for a manager role. However, his "abrasive" communication style is noted as a barrier to reaching a director level. To address this, Noah should seek feedback on specific instances of abrasive communication, practice active listening and empathetic responses, and consider communication workshops or coaching to refine his interpersonal skills.
