Her input were very insightful and original with some good thinking to back up. However, she has shown decreased interest and motivation at her assigned tasks lately and seems to wander off during office hour more often. Her work were actually decent and satisfactory.","true","true","Neutral-mixed","Emotion-driven","Destructive"

They are very driven, and focused on the task at hand. They give their all in whatever they put their mind to. They have good potential. The work that Bethany produces is of good quality.","false","false","Positive","Results-driven","Constructive"
"A3","Idea-to-Text","9","48","Wade Stanley","Category 1: 'Risk' (Low performance, Low potential)","Wade Stanley was late to work for the 3rd time this week. He comes into work out of dress code most days. It's not uncommon for him to leave earlier than he is scheduled to. Many days he isn't very friendly and sometimes even hostile towards his fellow co workers and clients. It is important we review if he is truly the type of person this company needs. We can only assume he is asking to be fired.","false","false","Negative","Emotion-driven","Destructive"
"A4","Idea-to-Text","4","15","George Gill","Category 1: 'Risk' (Low performance, Low potential)","George was given ample warning last quarter that his work had fallen below respectable levels. This quarter, George's input in our division has remained subpar. He doesn't seem committed to changing his behavior and shows no enthusiasm towards his job or towards his fellow colleagues. I strongly recommend that we terminate his contract.","false","true","Negative","Results-driven","Constructive"

"A6","Idea-to-Text","84","685","Frederick Rogers","Category 9: 'Star' (High performance, High potential)","Frederick is an absolute role model in the work force. He consistently produces extremely high quality work that far exceeds the expectations of our organization. He seldom makes mistakes and always learns from them if he does. Additionally he is an extremely diligent learner and constantly seeks to learn and improve him self. Not only does he produce amazing work, but he has the potential to become even better as he gains more experience.","false","false","Positive","Results-driven","Constructive"
"A7","Summarise","63","539","Brantley Whitfield","Category 7: 'Potential Gem' (Low performance, High potential)","Brantley's confidence issues have really impacted his performance in a negative way. He's a new member of the team, so I'll cut him some slack. But he's constantly questioning whether he's approaching his assignments in the right way. Moreover his self-doubt impacts the impression that he gives to clients, so I'm always nervous to have him with me in meetings. I think, Brantley has a ton of room to grow.","false","true","Neutral-mixed","Emotion-driven","Destructive"
"A8","Summarise","38","10181","Camille Hahn","Category 4: 'Inconsistent Player' (Low performance, Moderate potential)","Camille Hahn performance shows a lot of inconsistency.

We believe that she has potential to do better in the future.","false","false","Positive","Results-driven","Constructive"
"A9","Summarise","23","255","Matthew Reid","Category 3: 'Solid Performer' (High performance, Low potential)","Mr. Reid has been with the company for the last two years. His work is consistent and he puts his full effort into his work. He follows instructions well, but his abilities seem limited to his current experience level. Other workers hired at the same time have shown more growth within the field.","false","false","Neutral-mixed","Results-driven","Constructive"

He achieves at the level that is expected of him and complies with what is expected. He is a valuable asset to our team. I would like to see Alex to strive to go above and behind in his work. I believe that he has great potential to become a more critical component within the company. Alex can strive to improve his communication skills in specifically.","false","false","Positive","Emotion-driven","Constructive"
"A11","Summarise","72","615","Alina Britt","Category 8: 'High Potential' (Moderate performance, High potential)","Alina's work for this project was not as good as her previous work, however, it is still very much usable. Alina's work in the past has been remarkable- she pays close attention to detail, triple checks her work, and always makes sure her work is as clear and concise as it can be. I always look forward to working with Alina, because her work is, as I stated before, quite well put together.","false","false","Positive","Results-driven","Destructive"
"A12","Summarise","82","682","Frederick Rogers","Category 9: 'Star' (High performance, High potential)","I have been so impessed with Frederick Rogers work at our company. Fred as he prefers to be called, outshines the competition every single day; he goes above and beyond what is expected of him. If Fred keeps doing what he has been I feel as he will be able to climb up in our infrastructure. He has been an outstanding employee and I'm so glad he works for our company!","false","false","Positive","Emotion-driven","Constructive"

"A15","Interpret","29","10220","Dean Phillips","Category 3: 'Solid Performer' (High performance, Low potential)","Dean is overall a very effective worker. He is very punctual; he always shows up to work on time and gets his work done in the time allotted. The marketing content he produces for our organization is appealing and spot on for our target audience. He is a great team player and knows how to collaborate with his team and not step on any toes. One area that needs work is that he is not a risk taker and rarely initiates new ideas and projects of his own, but rather waits to be told what to do.","true","true","Neutral-mixed","Emotion-driven","Destructive"
"A16","Interpret","53","462","Noah Cooke","Category 6: 'High Performer' (High performance, Moderate potential)","Noah is a really key member to have on our team and I am grateful for all the ways in which he steps up to deliver high quality work for our clients. For example, he's always the first to volunteer for assignments. He's always the last one to leave the office, since he's so committed to reviewing reports and double checking his work in a painstaking way. I can certainly see Noah's dedication as an asset in a manager role in the future. However, I don't see him reaching the director level since he is somewhat abrasive in his communication skills.","false","false","Positive","Results-driven","Constructive"
"A17","Interpret","27","10216","Dean Phillips","Category 3: 'Solid Performer' (High performance, Low potential)","Dean has contributed heavily to the project in the past quarter.

He also does not handle high pressure situations well.","false","false","Neutral-mixed","Results-driven","Constructive"
"A18","Interpret","75","10115","Clay Terry","Category 8: 'High Potential' (Moderate performance, High potential)","Clay's performance is ok, but the potential is there to do much better. He seems a bit unmotivaed and lazy at times, but when the other workers get going, he normally performs in the top earning position. He does not do this all the time though. Only when other workers are around and when they get going. It's almost like Clay likes to compete, but only when others are activley competing too. Otherwise, he is not a very good performer.","true","true","Neutral-mixed","Results-driven","Destructive"
