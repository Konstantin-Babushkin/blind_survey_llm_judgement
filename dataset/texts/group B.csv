"B1","Idea-to-Text","64","540","Brantley Whitfield","Category 7: 'Potential Gem' (Low performance, High potential)","Brantley continues to be less productive than I believe he could be. He is intelligent and when he pushes himself, he has been able to suggest ways to increase productivity and profit in his department. If he improves in his productivity, he could become an invaluable asset to the company. He may need some guidance to find his ideal position.","false","true","Negative","Emotion-driven","Destructive"
"B2","Idea-to-Text","42","345","Kyle Lawson","Category 5: 'Core Player' (Moderate performance, Moderate potential)","Kyle is a very middle-of-the-pack employee. He has shown average proficiency in his job duties. He also has shown some flashes that he could progress beyond his current role, but only minor ones. His numbers are also at or near the median amongst the rest of his employees. Overall, I would say he's average at best and at worst.","false","false","Neutral-mixed","Results-driven","Destructive"
"B3","Idea-to-Text","0","1","John Doe","Category 1: 'Risk' (Low performance, Low potential)","John has not progressed in his position. He is continuously late, leaves early, and takes many breaks throughout the day. He calls out at least every other week and it's always on Fridays. His performance has significantly declined. My suggestion is he is not suitable for this position.","false","true","Negative","Results-driven","Constructive"
"B4","Idea-to-Text","54","436","Natasha Richardson","Category 6: 'High Performer' (High performance, Moderate potential)","Natasha has been delivering each project on time and meeting the stakeholders' expectations. During the review period, Natasha not only is able to resolve stakeholders' issues in time by recommending efficient solutions but also acts like a team player within the team. She should work more on thinking outside of the box. In order to achieve the goal, I recommend her to reach out to stakeholders by hosting a couple of follow up sessions.","true","false","Positive","Results-driven","Constructive"
"B5","Idea-to-Text","44","406","Alex Watts","Category 5: 'Core Player' (Moderate performance, Moderate potential)","Alex is a stable and consistent working on the team. He does what is required and necessary for the job and does it with minimal effort. Alex has a solid understand of his job and communicates well with others. Alex has been in his position an adequate amount of time, and we would encourage him to take on additional tasks and learn new tasks, to assist in career development.","false","false","Positive","Emotion-driven","Constructive"

"B7","Summarise","31","294","Isaac Parry","Category 4: 'Inconsistent Player' (Low performance, Moderate potential)","Isaac has demonstrated average performance this quarter. He was able to maintain an efficient workflow standard, and he was able to provide up-to-date and accurate analysis of data. Significant improvements, however, would be communication skills. He is encouraged to participate more actively in meetings and project discussions. His data analysis insights would definitely help his colleagues do their jobs better as well.","true","true","Positive","Results-driven","Constructive"
"B8","Summarise","10","138","April Craft","Category 2: 'Average performer' (Moderate performance, Low potential)","April Craft is your typical employee. She tends to do her job and show up on time. With that said she doesn't seem particularly interested in the work she is given. Hopefully we see some positive growth in the near future.","false","false","Neutral-mixed","Emotion-driven","Constructive"
"B9","Summarise","8","47","Wade Stanley","Category 1: 'Risk' (Low performance, Low potential)","Unfortunately, Mr. Stanley has shown time and time again that he has issues performing. For example, last week he had a deadline that he knew of, instead he took long lunches and never made the deadline. Also, his ability to show up on time and dressed accordingly has never happened. Everyday Wade has been a minimum of 15+ minutes late! This is very unacceptable, he is a nice person and I wish him the best, but potential for growth is not there.","false","false","Negative","Emotion-driven","Destructive"
"B10","Summarise","89","20024","Allan Logan","Category 9: 'Star' (High performance, High potential)","Allan Logan touches anything and it turns to gold. Nothing but the most capable hand in the team.

"B11","Summarise","26","10180","Aniya Sullivan","Category 3: 'Solid Performer' (High performance, Low potential)","Aniya is very good at what she does, and a favourite of the whole team. At the end of the quarter, she is one of the members we rely on the most due to her high output. She is a consistent worker. Unlikely to be moved into managerial roles as she has struggled with leadership.","false","false","Neutral-mixed","Results-driven","Constructive"
"B12","Summarise","76","10198","Riley Gardner","Category 8: 'High Potential' (Moderate performance, High potential)","Riley is an excellent worker who gets her work done whenever we need her.

"B13","Interpret","49","10186","Logan Russell","Category 5: 'Core Player' (Moderate performance, Moderate potential)","Logan is a normal employee, his performance are not bad but not excellent. He is doing some sales and his number show us that he is not bad, He is always willing to take the hardest customers to deal with, and that is why we appreciate him. He have a moderate potential in our enterprise because he is not putting as much effort as we want him too. Overall he's not bad but could be better.","false","true","Neutral-mixed","Results-driven","Destructive"
"B14","Interpret","65","542","Kallie Beard","Category 7: 'Potential Gem' (Low performance, High potential)","Kallie right now is in an interesting position. She is performing really poorly, not meeting deadlines, and generally produces low quality work. However, she has given an incredible amount of effort into improving herself and learning from her mistakes. She always responds well to feed back and proactively seeks to improve herself. Although she is isn;t doing well now, she will definitely improve with experience.","false","true","Positive","Results-driven","Constructive"
"B15","Interpret","60","534","George Jones","Category 7: 'Potential Gem' (Low performance, High potential)","George does not complete work on time and needs to be constantly supervised. He does show high potential due to the work he does eventually submit. George is very intelligent but some incentive should be made to get him to realize his potential. George could probably choose a different career path within the company to ignite his ambition. George might seem lazy sometimes but shows high potential of being a great contributor.","true","true","Positive","Results-driven","Constructive"
"B16","Interpret","13","147","Bailey Hunter","Category 2: 'Average performer' (Moderate performance, Low potential)","Bailey Hunter's daily production oscillates from poor to excellent from day-to day. One day Bailey will competently produce a 50-page brief and the next day will struggle to complete five transmittal letters. Her interpersonal skills are unexceptional, neither good nor bad. On balance, I don't believe she is long for this job.","false","true","Neutral-mixed","Emotion-driven","Constructive"
"B17","Interpret","33","316","Jay Reid","Category 4: 'Inconsistent Player' (Low performance, Moderate potential)","Jay frequently shows up late to the office and misses deadlines that have been set for his assignments.
