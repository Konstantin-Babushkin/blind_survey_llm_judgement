"C1","Idea-to-Text","28","10219","Dean Phillips","Category 3: 'Solid Performer' (High performance, Low potential)","Working individually, Dean has exceeded expectations. However, he lacks many basic communication skills that interfere with his ability to integrate within the team and have his voice heard. These shortcomings don't affect project contribution as Dean has been used to working on individual projects. As a member, Dean accomplishes many tasks for the team but is not suitable for any other role.","false","false","Neutral-mixed","Emotion-driven","Constructive"
"C2","Idea-to-Text","57","10148","Bethany Cunningham","Category 6: 'High Performer' (High performance, Moderate potential)","Bethany Cunningham is great at her job; she meets what is expected of her and beyond. This company would not function as smoothly as it does without her. Her attitude about increasing her knowledge of our field is concerning, though, she's more worried about her work life balance; that is, perform her duties and leave. She could move up, but I think she's just content with where she's at.","false","true","Positive","Emotion-driven","Constructive"

"C4","Idea-to-Text","18","20009","Elliot Gray","Category 2: 'Average performer' (Moderate performance, Low potential)","Elliot Gray attends all staff meetings and has been presented with daily targets, which are met about 65% of the time. At times it appears that Elliot struggles to display ambition to succeed and close deals. He rarely seeks out new potential clients and at times can be rather timid in his approach, reducing the confidence in the transaction. It is therefore not recommended that his name be put forth for promotion at this time as his leadership potential is not high.","false","true","Neutral-mixed","Results-driven","Constructive"

She has proven time and time again that new tasks are no problem for her, and she is able to quickly adapt to new situations. She has great potential to improve in the future.

She's repeatedly turned in work product containing typos, grammar issues, and content mistakes. The good thing is that I trust that Kallie will make great strides moving forward to improve. Every time I give her feedback or mark up documents for her, she takes my comments very seriously and always does better the next time. I believe she has the will and desire to become a reliable member of our department.","true","true","Neutral-mixed","Results-driven","Constructive"

"C9","Summarise","40","365","Joseph Cook","Category 5: 'Core Player' (Moderate performance, Moderate potential)","Joseph Cook is a consistent performer. He always gets the basic job done even though he could do better. He does not take as much time as he should to be at a higher performance level. He has shown only moderate potential which is risky.","false","true","Positive","Results-driven","Constructive"
"C10","Summarise","67","544","Kallie Beard","Category 7: 'Potential Gem' (Low performance, High potential)","Kallie within the past term hasn't quite adjusted to our team yet. She seems to still be fitting into the workload and finding a place to really catch a stride. Because of this, her performance isn't quite at our team's expectation yet. However, she possess skills and an attitude that can immensely pay off very soon once she learns the ropes.","false","true","Neutral-mixed","Emotion-driven","Constructive"

I would like to say more positive things about him but he has not shown any potential in regards to his work. He often is late and smells poorly despite our company guidelines.

He is able to contribute up to 80% of his abilities & skill set. Would like him to work on his weaknesses & multiply strength areas in order to become a better contributor. He is a vital member of the team for this project.

His work is quite impressive, never late, and some of the finest on our division. However, with such a great work ethic that he fails to apply fully to reaching a higher position in this company, I believe he has his eyes on other ventures. I would love to recruit and keep Matthew in our company, but I can't trust that we won't pour resources into his success only for him to leave for a bigger company.","false","false","Neutral-mixed","Emotion-driven","Destructive"
