A1,"Elliot is fairly effective at managing his workload. He has been a consistent team member. Though, he has not sought help to achieve better results. He needs initiative to become one of our rising stars."
A2,"Chelsea is an absolutely amazing worker. She always produces the highest quality work that exceeds our expectations. Not only that, she constantly seeks to learn and improve her self to produce better work. Not only is she extremely competent, she has the potential to produce even higher quality work as she progresses"
A3,"Dean is overall a very effective worker. He is very punctual; he always shows up to work on time and gets his work done in the time allotted. The marketing content he produces for our organization is appealing and spot on for our target audience. He is a great team player and knows how to collaborate with his team and not step on any toes. One area that needs work is that he is not a risk taker and rarely initiates new ideas and projects of his own, but rather waits to be told what to do."
A4,"Noah is a really key member to have on our team and I am grateful for all the ways in which he steps up to deliver high quality work for our clients. For example, he's always the first to volunteer for assignments. He's always the last one to leave the office, since he's so committed to reviewing reports and double checking his work in a painstaking way. I can certainly see Noah's dedication as an asset in a manager role in the future. However, I don't see him reaching the director level since he is somewhat abrasive in his communication skills."
A5,"Dean has contributed heavily to the project in the past quarter. He has led the team charts in task completion. However, he has struggled with taking up responsibilities to deliver complex tasks. He also does not handle high pressure situations well."
A6,"Clay's performance is ok, but the potential is there to do much better. He seems a bit unmotivaed and lazy at times, but when the other workers get going, he normally performs in the top earning position. He does not do this all the time though. Only when other workers are around and when they get going. It's almost like Clay likes to compete, but only when others are activley competing too. Otherwise, he is not a very good performer."
A7,"Logan is a normal employee, his performance are not bad but not excellent. He is doing some sales and his number show us that he is not bad, He is always willing to take the hardest customers to deal with, and that is why we appreciate him. He have a moderate potential in our enterprise because he is not putting as much effort as we want him too. Overall he's not bad but could be better."
A8,"Kallie right now is in an interesting position. She is performing really poorly, not meeting deadlines, and generally produces low quality work. However, she has given an incredible amount of effort into improving herself and learning from her mistakes. She always responds well to feed back and proactively seeks to improve herself. Although she is isn;t doing well now, she will definitely improve with experience."
A9,George does not complete work on time and needs to be constantly supervised. He does show high potential due to the work he does eventually submit. George is very intelligent but some incentive should be made to get him to realize his potential. George could probably choose a different career path within the company to ignite his ambition. George might seem lazy sometimes but shows high potential of being a great contributor.
A10,"Bailey Hunter's daily production oscillates from poor to excellent from day-to day. One day Bailey will competently produce a 50-page brief and the next day will struggle to complete five transmittal letters. Her interpersonal skills are unexceptional, neither good nor bad. On balance, I don't believe she is long for this job."
A11,Jay frequently shows up late to the office and misses deadlines that have been set for his assignments. Unfortunately each assignment I've received from him to date has been subpar since they frequently have math errors.
A12,"Natasha has proven to be an effective worker. She consistently creates excellent work on time. Her performance within the company is very strong. However, we do not see her currently moving forward within the company at this time due to a number of issues that be discussed if requested."
A13,Kohen Norris has been for a lack of better words incompetent. I would like to say more positive things about him but he has not shown any potential in regards to his work. He often is late and smells poorly despite our company guidelines. I feel it is in our best interest to drop him from the company.
A14,"Thaddeus is a talented resource though he is not focused many of the times. He is able to contribute up to 80% of his abilities & skill set. Would like him to work on his weaknesses & multiply strength areas in order to become a better contributor. He is a vital member of the team for this project. However, would like him to become a main asset in fulfilling team objectives on regular occasions to climb up the ladder in hierarchy."
A15,"Emilie has quickly made her self an important asset here in the business and is quickly rising in the ranks. Having surpassed her sales target by 72% this month, massively contributing to the teams quarterly win in the Summer Sale Bonanza. We're pleased to announce that her appointment as the new hot desk team leader, ready to take on the more challenging queries we get. Emilie is an inspiration to us all, lets hope we can all follow in her footsteps!"
A16,"My friend and colleague, Matthew Reid, is a great addition to any team. His work is quite impressive, never late, and some of the finest on our division. However, with such a great work ethic that he fails to apply fully to reaching a higher position in this company, I believe he has his eyes on other ventures. I would love to recruit and keep Matthew in our company, but I can't trust that we won't pour resources into his success only for him to leave for a bigger company."
A17,"Jay Reid's level of work has been very disappointing given the kind of skills he possess. With the right attitude and possibly with a few work adjustments, his work quality could improve."
A18,"George didn't deliver as well as hoped. However, he displays a great deal of all skills necessary for growth. With time, George will prove to be an asset to the company. Given the opportunity, George has the ability to advance beyond his given skill set."
